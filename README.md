# hello-world
My first project

Hello World!
This is my first github repository. I am about to embark on the 100daysofcode challenge and I need to create a repository to log my progress. I have never used github before, so this is where I begin to reach my goal. I would like to expand my skills as a front-end web developer. I love coding!

Thanks,
Sue
